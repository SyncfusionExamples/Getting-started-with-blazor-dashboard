## Features and Benefits

### Dynamic layout design

The Blazor Dashboard component allows dynamic designing of the layout by adding, removing, resizing, floating, and reordering the panels within the layout.

#### Drag and drop

Allows smooth dragging of the panels to replace or re-order at the desired position within the layout.

#### Resizing

Easy resizing of a panel in all directions enables quick designing of the layout, and fitting small or large sized content conveniently.

#### Floating

The panels within the layout will auto arrange by moving in the upward direction to occupy empty spaces available in the layout. This provides effective usage of the layout for panel placement.

### Placing components as content

Place any HTML content or HTML UI components like Grid, Charts, Gauge, Maps, etc. to represent the metrics or KPI as panel content inside the dashboards.

### Responsive and adaptive layout

Design a mobile-friendly responsive dashboard that fits all resolutions without any data loss. Stacked panel display is much more adaptive to lower resolutions. You can also refer this [documentation](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/dashboard-layout/responsive-adaptive/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=blazor-dashboard-github-samples) for more details.
